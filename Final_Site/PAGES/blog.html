                                <p>by Aaron at Emerson Knives</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="bodycopy">Easily one of the most common questions we get is, “Which blade type should I get?”. It sounds like a simple question, but it is completely determined by how you plan on using your Emerson knife.</p>
                                <p class="bodycopy">Although we cannot choose which knife you plan to get, we can definitely push you in the direction that suits your needs best.</p>
                                <h5>Plain Edge</h5>
                                <p class="bodycopy">A plain edged blade is one that has the shame grind all the way through. The majority of knife owners will have a plain edge because it serves the basic needs that may come up. Collectors usually opt for a plain edge for the “cleaner”, more traditional look.</p>
                                <p><strong>Good for:</strong></p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Basic Utility Purposes</li>
                                    <li>Self Defense</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <h5>Serrated Edge</h5>
                                <p class="bodycopy">Commonly referred to as “teeth”, this is the saw-like edge of the blade that is used to dig into tough materials. Emerson Knives offers the option for your knife to be partially serrated where we will add teeth to approximately a third of the blade near the base. This leaves enough plain edge so that you have enough of both to get any job done.</p>
                                <p><strong>Good for:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Outdoors/Camping</li>
                                    <li>Hunting</li>
                                    <li>Rope-Cutting/Seat Belt Cutting</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <h5>More Info</h5>
                                <p class="bodycopy">Emerson Knives with serrated edges are popular among law enforcement as well as firefighters who need the added utility of the blade.</p>
                                <p class="bodycopy">If you decide to go with a plain edge, you have the option to add serrations to your blade later down the road, should you choose to do so. As you can imagine, we cannot remove serrations from a blade. If you want to add serrations to your blade, you just need to send in your knife along with a Service/Repair Form.</p>

                                    <p>Jani Actman</p>
                                    <br>                                    
                                    <p class="bodycopy">For 20,000 years the remains of millions of woolly mammoths remained locked in permafrost in Siberia and elsewhere—until recently. Warming temperatures have melted this icy layer, bringing their valuable ivory teeth within grasp and leading to a burgeoning trade.</p>
                                    <p class="bodycopy">For several years conservationists have said this trade is hurting mammoths’ modern-day relatives: African elephants, which face a poaching crisis. The international trade in elephant ivory has been banned since 1990, but smugglers try to get away with selling elephant ivory by claiming it’s legal mammoth ivory, which looks nearly identical to the untrained eye.</p>
                                    <p class="bodycopy">Now in hopes of solving the problem, Israel wants to make it tougher to trade in mammoth ivory. It’s proposed a measure that will be voted on at the meeting next month in South Africa of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the treaty that regulates wildlife trade across borders.</p>
                                    <p class="bodycopy">"The gist of the Israel document is to make sure intentional mislabeling doesn't happen so that the mammoth ivory trade doesn't contribute to laundering illicit ivory," says Iris Ho, wildlife program manager at Humane Society International.</p>
                                    <p class="bodycopy">Nearly 90 percent of mammoth ivory exported out of Siberia—estimated at about 60 tons a year—ends up in China, which is also the main destination for illegal elephant ivory. Poachers kill some 30,000 elephants a year for their tusks, many of which get carved into pricey art and trinkets, just like mammoth ivory. (Also see “U.S.-China Deal to Ban Ivory Trade Is Good News for Elephants”)</p>

                                        <p>by William E. Weiss</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p class="bodycopy">Remember that carrying any weapon, even one that’s legal, can cause you a lot of grief with law enforcement.  Cops routinely write tickets and make arrests for things they incorrectly think are illegal, or full well know not to be illegal. Beating a rap in court is great, but better is never being there in the first place.</p>
                                        <p class="bodycopy">Here are the baseline knife laws in California.</p>
                                        <h5>Concealed Knives, Dirks, and Daggers – Penal Codes § 12020, § 20200 & § 21310</h5>
                                        <p class="bodycopy">In California, folded pocked knives are legal, but it is illegal for any person to concealed carry any knife legally described as a “dirk” or “dagger” — the legal terms for any fixed-blade knife or stabbing weapon.  See § 12020(4). Even a locked pocket knife can count, so can a screwdriver in some cases. See § 16470.  BUT carrying a “dirk” or “dagger” in an openly-worn sheath hanging on your hip is not concealment within the meaning of the statute.  See § 12020(25)(d) and § 20200.   </p>
                                        <h5>Switchblades  – Penal Codes § 17235 & 21510</h5>
                                        <p class="bodycopy">Switchblades and other spring-loaded knives are illegal in California if their blade is 2″ or longer. A switchblade is a knife with “the appearance of a pocketknife and includes a spring-blade knife, snap-blade knife, gravity knife, or any other similar type knife, the blade or blades of which are two or more inches in length and which can be released automatically by a flick of a button, pressure on the handle, flip of the wrist or other mechanical device, or is released by the weight of the blade or by any type of mechanism whatsoever.” See § 17235.  The statute expressly excludes pocket knives that can be opened with one hand by pushing the blade open with one’s thumb, as long as the knife “has a detent or other mechanism that provides resistance that must be overcome in opening the blade, or that biases the blade back toward its closed position.”  See § 17235.  Basically, your regular pocket knife is legal, and switchblades are legal if they’re under 2″.   </p>
                                        <p class="bodycopy">The law is zero tolerance on these, and they’ll bang you with a misdemeanor charge if you: (a) possess the knife in the passenger’s or driver’s area of any motor vehicle in any public place or place open to the public; (b) carry the knife upon the person; (c) sell, offer for sale, expose for sale, loan, transfer, or gives the knife to any other person. See § 21510.  The Court of Appeals held that possession of a switchblade in a person’s pocket, boot, etc., is unlawful, even if even if in one’s own home.  See People v. S.C. (2009).  Modifying a pocket knife into a switchblade-like knife makes it a switchblade.  See People v. Angel R. (2008). </p>
                                        <h5>Cane Swords and other Disguised Blades – Penal Codes § 16590 </h5>
                                        <p class="bodycopy">Generally, any knife or blade that is disguised so as to not look like a weapon is also illegal in California. See § 16590.  This includes, cane swords (§ 16340), belt-buckle knives (§ 16260), lipstick case knives (§ 16830), air gauge knives (§ 16140), writing pen knives (§ 17359), so-called ballistic knives (§ 16220), a staff or crutch (§ 17260), etc.  Blades that are undetectable to metal detectors (e.g., ceramic blades) are also illegal. See § 20810 and § 17290.  Remember, just because your blade isn’t explicitly described under the law, doesn’t mean the cops can’t find some way to write you up under the closest description.  I once had a client wearing rings the police magically made into “metal knuckles” under PC § 21810 because he was wearing a cut. They also used the cut to add a gang enhancement to the “weapon” of rings, sorry, “metal knuckles.”       </p>
